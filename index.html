<h1>E-100</h1>
<p>What was the E-100? That is not a bad question. After all it hardly receives
any attention when compared with its Big Brother, The Maus.
<br>
To understand what the E-100 is, you would have to examine, or be briefly briefed on the Maus.

</p>
<br>
<p>The Maus was a large tank,the largest of all time, weighing in at a whopping 188 tons.
  Because the Germans are the most sarcastis peoples of all time, they named it after a mouse.
