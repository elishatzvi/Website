<title>E-100 vs Maus</title>

<h1>E-100</h1>
<p>What was the E-100? That is not a bad question. After all it hardly receives
any attention when compared with its Big Brother, The Maus.
<br>
To understand what the E-100 is, you would have to examine, or be briefed on the Maus.

</p>
<br>
<p>The Maus was a large tank,the largest of all time, weighing in at a whopping 188 tons.
  Because the Germans are the most sarcastic people of all time, they named it after a mouse.
  The Maus was a moving bunker, in every sense of the word. The Maus was armed with a 128 mm Pak-44 anti-tank field artillery.
  As every World of Tanks gamer will tell you, "I wish my tank had a second gun." So the Nazis did just that.
  Its secondary armanament consisted of a 75 mm co-axial Kwk 44 L/36.5 gun. It also had a co-axial 7.92 mm MG-34.
  I keep mentioning the word co-axial.But what does it actually mean? Good question.
  Co-axial means that the secondary and other armanament moves with the primary armanament in the turret.
  <br>
  The Maus and E-100 had one crucial difference, ROLE.
  <br>
  The maus was very much a defensive tank, when the panzer army needed an objective to be held or as covering fire,
  in short, it was a mobile,heavily armed and armoured, artillery piece.
  <br>
  The E-100 was a breakthrough tank, when the panzer army needed to take an objective,
   with it thick armour bouncing shells, Its 150mm gun blasting any resistance.
   <br>
   Now for the technical stuff. The panzerkampfwagen VIII E-100, otherwise known as the GÃ«rat 383 and TG-01,
   was a german super-heavy tank design developed towards the end of WW2. It was the largest of the Entwicklung,or E, series of
   vehicles, which consisted of the E-10,E-25,E-50,E75 & The E-100. It took till the end of the war for just the chassis to
   be partially completed. The chassis was then sipped to the UK for trials,
   but was later consigned to the scrapheap.
   <br>
   The basic design was ordered by the Waffenamt as a parallel project to the porsche Maus in June of 1943.
   It was the heaviest of the E-series,projected to weigh 100 tons.
 </p>
<br>
<p>In March 1944, the Adler company of Frankfurt gave their design "021A38300" for a super-heavy tank design
  which they called The E-100.
</p>
<br>
<p>So... Which one was better? I personally can't say for sure, so I'll let you decide.
  Although... I personally prefer The ........... E-100. Alot of people also prefer the Maus for its sheer historical signifigance.

  Thanks for reading.
